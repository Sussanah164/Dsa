# Amazon Product Review Analysis (My DSA Incubator Project)
In my project at DSA Incubator, I developed a comprehensive Excel-based analytics solution to analyze Amazon product reviews, discounts, and pricing. By leveraging pivot tables, slicers, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards, I extracted valuable insights into product performance, category trends, customer engagement, and revenue growth opportunities.
